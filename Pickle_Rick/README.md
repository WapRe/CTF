# Pickle_Rick_CTF
This is my first CTF that I have done, from https://tryhackme.com/room/picklerick

I wrote down everything I tried as I progressed, the ideas I had, and the results I obtained. 

It may not be very understandable, as it is written in a note-taking format rather than a presentable format.
