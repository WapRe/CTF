# BasicPentesting
I attempted this CTF on https://tryhackme.com/room/basicpentestingjt  
Here, I have all the notes of the ideas I gathered and how I progressed in this CTF. 

I came across a part that I was not able to solve.

I was not very clear about the enumeration part, as well as the concept of the private key required to solve the puzzle. 
However, I tried until I got stuck and followed the resolution with the best intention of learning.
